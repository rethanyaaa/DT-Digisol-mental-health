            In today's fast-paced world, our mental health is often overlooked, buried beneath responsibilities, expectations, and daily struggles. But just like physical health, our emotional well-being deserves care, attention, and timely support.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you've been feeling overwhelmed, anxious, emotionally drained, or simply unheard, know that you are not alone. Seeking help is not a sign of weaknessâ€”it is a step toward strength, clarity, and a healthier mind.

            Many emotional struggles start smallâ€”stress, self-doubt, relationship conflicts, or work pressure. When left unaddressed, these can build up, leading to anxiety, depression, or other serious disorders. The good news? Early intervention through talk therapy can prevent this.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Just as we visit a doctor for a minor cold before it turns into a severe illness, counseling helps the mind recover before emotional distress deepens.
