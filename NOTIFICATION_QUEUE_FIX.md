# Notification Queue Fix for Doctor Waiting Room

## Problem
Previously, doctors would only receive notifications about patients joining the waiting room if the doctor had already joined the waiting room first. This created a problematic dependency where:

1. **Patient joins first** → No doctor to notify → Doctor never gets notified
2. **Doctor joins first** → Doctor gets notified when patients join

## Solution
Implemented a **notification queue system** that stores notifications for doctors who haven't joined yet.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Added Pending Notifications Queue
```javascript
this.pendingNotifications = new Map(); // roomId -> [notifications]
```

#### 2. Modified Patient Join Logic
- **Before**: Only notify doctor if already in waiting room
- **After**: Queue notification if doctor not present, notify immediately if present

```javascript
// Create notification data
const notificationData = {
  roomId,
  patient: patientInfo,
  appointment,
  timestamp: new Date(),
};

// Notify doctor if online, otherwise queue the notification
if (waitingRoom.doctor) {
  // Send immediate notification
  this.io.to(waitingRoom.doctor.socketId).emit("patient-joined-waiting-room", notificationData);
} else {
  // Queue notification for when doctor joins
  if (!this.pendingNotifications.has(roomId)) {
    this.pendingNotifications.set(roomId, []);
  }
  this.pendingNotifications.get(roomId).push(notificationData);
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Doctor Join Logic
When a doctor joins, all pending notifications are sent immediately:

```javascript
// Send all pending notifications to the doctor
if (this.pendingNotifications.has(roomId)) {
  const pendingNotifications = this.pendingNotifications.get(roomId);
  
  pendingNotifications.forEach(notification => {
    if (notification.type) {
      // Handle typed notifications (device test, ready status, etc.)
      switch (notification.type) {
        case "device-test-completed":
          this.io.to(waitingRoom.doctor.socketId).emit("patient-device-test-completed", notification.data);
          break;
        case "ready-status-changed":
          this.io.to(waitingRoom.doctor.socketId).emit("patient-ready-status-changed", notification.data);
          break;
      }
    } else {
      // Handle patient join notifications
      this.io.to(waitingRoom.doctor.socketId).emit("patient-joined-waiting-room", notification);
    }
  });
  
  // Clear pending notifications
  this.pendingNotifications.delete(roomId);
}
```

#### 4. Extended to Other Events
The same queue system is now used for:
- Patient device test completion
- Patient ready status changes
- Patient join events

#### 5. Proper Cleanup
- Pending notifications are cleared when doctor joins
- Pending notifications are cleaned up when waiting rooms are deleted
- Memory leaks are prevented

## Benefits

1. **No Order Dependency**: Patients can join before or after the doctor
2. **Immediate Notifications**: Doctor gets notified of all patients as soon as they join
3. **No Lost Notifications**: All patient events are captured and delivered
4. **Clean State Management**: Pending notifications are cleared after delivery
5. **Better User Experience**: Doctors see all waiting patients immediately

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Patient Joins First
1. Patient joins waiting room → Notification queued
2. Doctor joins later → Receives all queued notifications immediately
3. **Result**: Doctor sees all patients who joined before them

### Scenario 2: Doctor Joins First
1. Doctor joins waiting room → No pending notifications
2. Patient joins later → Doctor receives immediate notification
3. **Result**: Real-time notifications work as before

### Scenario 3: Multiple Events
1. Patient joins → Notification queued
2. Patient completes device test → Notification queued
3. Patient changes ready status → Notification queued
4. Doctor joins → Receives all 3 notifications in correct order
5. **Result**: Complete event history delivered to doctor

## Files Modified

- `backend/socketServer.js` - Main implementation of notification queue system

## Debug Information

The system includes extensive console logging to help debug:
- When notifications are queued
- When notifications are sent to doctors
- The content of pending notifications
- Room state changes

This ensures the notification queue system is working correctly and helps identify any issues during development.
